#RSkel

Automatic code skeleton generator

Supports _two_ dynamic languages (Ruby, Python) and _two_ static languages (C++, Java)

Includes functionality to test for validity of method names for certain languages, e.g. you can have * in the method signatures in C++ but not in Java.

To run, just expand everything in one directory and do

**$ ruby ui.rb**

More to come.
